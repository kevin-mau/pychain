# *PyChain Ledger
---
### Using Python and Steamlit we build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface.  This ledger allows users to conduct financial transactions and verify the integrity of the data in the ledger. 
### Within the `PyChain` Ledger, we will create a `record` data class that will consist of the transaction's three attributes: the `sender`, the `receiver`, and the `amount`.  These three attributes are stored in the `Block` data class.  We will build input areas for the three attributes to be captured and stored through the Streamlit application.  Finally, we test the `PyChain` Ledger and user interface by running the Streamlit application and test the blockchain validation process by using the `PyChain` ledger.

## Installation Guide

Prior to running the application, you will need to install these dependencies:

```python
  pip install pandas
  pip install streamlit
```

## Technologies:

This application utilizes python 3.7 along with the below imports:

```python
  import streamlit as st
  from dataclasses import dataclass
  from typing import Any, List
  import datetime as datetime
  import pandas as pd
  import hashlib
```
---
## Instructions:

In the terminal, navigate to the cloned repo and run the Streamlit application by using `streamlit run pychain.py`.  Then simply enter values for sender, receiver, and amount, 
and then click the Add Block button.  You can verify the block contents and hashes in the Streamlit drop-down menu and also validate the blockchain with the "Validate Chain" 
button.

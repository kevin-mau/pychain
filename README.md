# PyChain Ledger Application
---
### Using Python and Steamlit we build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface.  This ledger allows users to conduct financial transactions and verify the integrity of the data in the ledger. 
### Within the `PyChain` ledger we create a `record` data class that will consist of the transaction's three attributes: the `sender`, the `receiver`, and the `amount`.  These three attributes are stored in the `Block` data class.  We will build input areas for the three attributes to be captured and stored through the Streamlit application.  
### Finally we test the `PyChain` ledger and user interface by running the Streamlit application and test the blockchain validation process by using the `PyChain` ledger.

## Installation Guide

You will need to install streamlit to your environment to run this application:

```python
  pip install streamlit
```

## Technologies:

This application utilizes python 3.7 along with the below imports:

```python
  import streamlit as st
  from dataclasses import dataclass
  from typing import Any, List
  import datetime as datetime
  import pandas as pd
  import hashlib
```
---
## Instructions:

Navigate to the location of the cloned repository in your terminal.  Run the Streamlit application by using this command: 

`streamlit run pychain.py` 

Enter the attributes of the financial transaction for sender, receiver, and amount.  

There is also a PyChain Block Difficulty slider bar at the top-left corner of the web interface.  

Click the "Add Block" button after all inputs have been entered.  

You can verify the block contents and hashes in the Streamlit drop-down menu.

Use the "Validate Chain" button to validate the blockchain.
